CSSTidy

Changelog: http://csstidy.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/csstidy/trunk/
The included 'NEWS' file in the distribution also tracks the latest changes.


css_optimiser.php is the optional web-interface for trying out various CSSTidy settings.
If you do not plan on using this, it is safe to delete the file.  One less PHP file to
worry about.
  An online version should be available here: http://cdburnerxp.se/cssparse/css_optimiser.php

class.csstidy*.php are the CSS classes that power CSSTidy.

Docs/* contains the CSSTidy documentation for developers.

templates/* contains templates that are loaded when data.inc.php is included.  Including
class.csstidy.php will include data.inc.php.  Templates describe the output content.

testing/* contains unit tests to validate that any changes to CSSTidy don't break stuff
before submitting them back into the repository.

To run the unit tests, you will need to install Pear::Text_Diff and download and put
SimpleTest (http://simpletest.org/) into the testing/ directory.


Sample PHP code:

<?php
	require_once "class.csstidy.php";

	$data = file_get_contents("test.css");

	$css = new csstidy();
	$css->set_cfg(array(
		"remove_last_;" => false,
		"sort_properties" => false,
		"template" => "altdefault"
	));

	$css->parse($data);

	$data = $css->print->plain();

	echo "<pre>";
	echo $data;
	echo "</pre>";
?>

Avoid naming any globals '$csstidy' as there could be conflicts.
